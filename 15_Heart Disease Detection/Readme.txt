(iii) Description: 
             In this project we used logistic Regression and implemented Heart Disease detetction where the user 
	     enters respective parameters and by using saved model weights it predicts weather user has heart disease or not. 
             The user enters required parameters via GUI which was hosted on ngrok. 
             The model showed 85% accuracy on training dataset and 82% on test dataset.
