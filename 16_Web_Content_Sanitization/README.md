#### Description :-

This project aims to sanitize the harmful text content on the web platforms by categorizing them into 6 distinct categories

- Toxic
- Obscene
- Threat
- Insult
- Severe Toxic
- Identity Hate

If the text belongs to any of this category then the whole flow is stopped & the further processing of the survey doesn't happen unless & until the further changes are made

When changes are made & the survey is published again then the text is again processed & if it passes all the checks then the further processing can take place & the survey is visible to the other users

It also contains the functionality to train the model & test the model in a standalone manner without initiating the entire process
