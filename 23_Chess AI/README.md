### What is our Project about?
We have created an Chess AI web application through which a user can play online with just a browser and internet. We have used client-server architecture for implementation of this project. Our AI uses basic fundamental algorithms for a zero sum and turn-based game i.e Chess. We have used Min-Max for searching game tree and Alpha-Beta Prunning with iterative deepening is used for optimization. Frontend is done by HTML,CSS & JS with backend using Python(Flask).
